                To begin, I would like to thank you for visiting my web page. I created this web page as part of my Project0 for HarvardX's CS50W course.
                The contents of this web page gives a little information of my career and professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have created a navigation pane with links for ease of navigation. The "Career" page gives a snapshot of my career choices and where I am today.
                In the "Professional Development" page I list my education, cerifications, and certifcates that have been awarded to me. Lastly, the "Additional Information"
                page was created for the instructors to view my web site's DOM as well as a link to view README.md file. I look forward to hearing your feedback!
            </p>

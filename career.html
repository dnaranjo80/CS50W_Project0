                Growing up I had two career aspirations - computers and aviation maintenance. After High School there were no online courses available
                and my working-class family did not have the money to send me to college. I enlisted in the United States Air Force and signed up to be a jet engine
                technician. I made it a career and served for 20 years, retiring in 2019. During that time I was challenged with technical training and leadership
                courses. I advanced through the enlisted ranks where I eventually retired at E-7. Half-way through my military career I found Capella University, which
                allowed me to complete my computing degree completely online, which I needed as I could be moved around the world at any moments notice. I continued to
                take advantage of my education benefits and will be completing my Masters degree in 2021. The Air Force sent me to many places - I spent 7 years in
                Japan, 3 years in California, and the rest in my home state of Texas, with a temporary duty locations and a deployment to Iraq in between.

            <p>
                Now that I have retired and completed my education, I can now persue my second career aspiraion - computers. I was hired on by a water utilities
                company and was given the position of Applications Adminsitrator. I oversee applications that deal with water management and telemetry systems.
                I have written scripts to help with the management of data flow as well as creating custom reports for my customers. I am happy to have been given
                the opportunity to chase both career aspirations I had as a teen.

                I began my educational journey in the Air Force. Being Regionally accredited, I was awarded my Associate of Applied Science in Aviation Maintenance
                Technology degree. That inspired me to go further, so I began persuing a Aviation Engineering degree while I was stationed in California. Due to not
                having many online-courses at my disposal, I was forced to stop pursuing that degree when I was moved back to Japan for a second tour. I stopped pursuing
                my education until I got stationed back in Texas, where a friend motivated me to re-start my education. With more online-courses available I found Capella
                University. I completed my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology, with a Minor in Mobile Systems Development. I took a year off of pursuing
                my education in lieu of finishing up a year-long leadership course in the Air Force, and then I began my Masters of Science degree in Cybersecurity. Upon
                retirement, my new employer required me to complete my Security+ certification, which I earned in 2019. I am now finishing up my final courses left for in
                my Masters degree and am projected to graduate in the Spring of 2021.
